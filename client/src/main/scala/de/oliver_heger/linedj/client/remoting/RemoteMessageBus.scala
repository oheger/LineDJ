 * sending messages to remote actors and receiving their responses. The basic
 * idea is that this bus is connected to a [[RemoteRelayActor]] and offers
 * convenience methods for sending a message to this actor. The sender is then
 * automatically subscribed to the underlying message bus. When a message is
 * received which the original sender can handler it is again unsubscribed.
