RemoteMediaStore
================

This is a test project exploring various technologies including
- Google AppEngine Java
- GWT
- Restful Web Services with Jersey
- OAUTH protocol
- JAXB
- Scala
- OSGi

The application deployed to Google AppEngine manages information about a personal
media library. Entities managed are artists, songs, media, and more. External
applications - e.g. an MP3 player software - can connect to the application
and obtain data about media or update the library when new songs are played.

On client side a MP3 player application is implemented which communicates with
the server. The player has a local database in which it stores information
about songs which have been played. A synchronize command updates the database
on the remote server.

Building
========
The project is built by Apache Maven. Unfortunately, not all required
dependencies are available in public Maven repositories. The following artifacs
have to be installed manually:
- com.google.appengine:appengine-local-runtime (current version)
  Test helper classes for the Google AppEngine.
  The artifact can be obtained for instance from an installation of the Google
  Eclipse plug-in.
