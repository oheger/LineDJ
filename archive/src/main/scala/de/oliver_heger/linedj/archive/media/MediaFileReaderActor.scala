/**
 * A specialized file reader actor for media files to be sent to clients.
 *
 * This class is an extended [[de.oliver_heger.linedj.io.FileReaderActor]]
 * that does some processing on the audio data it reads. Mainly, it removes all
 * information related to ID3v2 tags.
 *
 * The reasons for this processing is that the mp3 player library used for
 * audio playback has some issues with special kind of data contained in ID3
 * tags, especially images; such files can cause the engine to crash.
 * Another reason for removing ID3 information is that this reduces the size of
 * the files to be transferred to clients.
 *
 * @param readerActor the underlying reader actor
 * @param extractor the extractor for ID3 data
