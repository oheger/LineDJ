/**
 * A helper class that can be used to obtain a configurable chunk of data at
 * the end of a stream.
 *
 * Some meta data about audio files is stored at the end of a file. Therefore,
 * it is necessary to obtain this data in a convenient way. During meta data
 * extraction the audio file has to be read from start to end anyway. The
 * task of this class is to provide the last block of the given size after the
 * file has been processed.
 *
 * Usage of this class is as follows: For each file to be processed a new
 * instance is created with the block size past to the constructor. Then
 * chunks of data can be added of arbitrary size by calling ''addData()''.
 * When all chunks of data have been passed to the object the ''tail()''
 * method returns the last chunk of the configured size. Note that this
 * block may be smaller than configured if not enough data was added before.
 *
 * Implementation note: This class is not thread-safe.
 *
 * @param size the size of the block to be collected by this object
