 * completely. This is done by this actor. It interacts with a reader actor to
 * read a file chunk-wise. For each chunk of data read, a [[ProcessMp3Data]]
 * message is generated and sent to the collector actor. The collector actor
 * passes this information to the corresponding processing actors.
 *
 * So, this actor does no processing itself, but provides the source data on
