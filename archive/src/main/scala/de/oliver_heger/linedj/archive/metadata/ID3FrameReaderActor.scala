/**
 * An actor implementation for reading ID3v2 frames from an audio file.
 *
 * This is a processing actor used during meta data extraction from MP3 files.
 * Meta data extraction involves reading the whole MP3 file. This actor is
 * hooked into this process so that it can deal with ID3v2 frames.
 *
 * ID3v2 frames are always located at the beginning of the audio file. This
 * actor checks whether at the current position of the file an ID3 frame header
 * can be read. If this is the case, the content of the frame is requested and
 * passed to the meta data collector actor. From there it is delegated to an
 * instance which actually processes the content and extracts meta data.
 *
 * In order to avoid unrestricted memory consumption, ID3 frames are handled
 * in a single chunk only up to a configurable size. If a frame exceeds this
 * size, it is read in multiple chunks.
 *
 * @param readerActor the underlying reader actor
 * @param extractionContext the extraction context
