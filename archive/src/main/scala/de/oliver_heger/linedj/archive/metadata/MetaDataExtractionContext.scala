/**
 * A helper class providing central information and functionality required
 * during the extraction of meta data from audio files.
 *
 * In order to access a larger library of audio files in a comfortable way,
 * meta data about the files (like title, interpret, album, etc.) must be made
 * available. Therefore, after the directories containing media files have been
 * scanned, the detected files are processed to extract the relevant meta data
 * they contain. This is a complex and parallel process involving a bunch of
 * actors.
 *
 * This class contains some data used by many actors taking part in the
 * extraction process. For instance, it allows creating various kinds of
 * extractor objects for meta data. Further, the reference to the actor
 * collecting the meta data found can be queried.
 *
 * @param collectorActor the actor collecting all kinds of meta data results
 * @param config the media server configuration
