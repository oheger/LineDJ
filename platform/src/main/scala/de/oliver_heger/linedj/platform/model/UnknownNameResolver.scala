/**
 * A trait for resolving the names of unknown references.

 * Meta data for a song may be incomplete, for instance information about the
 * artist or the album of a song may be missing. What to display in this case
 * is probably not constant, but can depend on the language of the current
 * user. This trait defines methods for querying names of unknown references.
 * Concrete implementations can use different strategies for looking up such
 * names, e.g. via a resource manager.
