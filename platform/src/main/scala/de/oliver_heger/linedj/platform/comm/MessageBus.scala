/**
 * A trait defining a bus for publishing messages to registered listeners.
 *
 * This bus is used for both the internal communication in the UI of an
 * application and the communication to the remote server. The idea is that
 * multiple listeners can register at the bus and are then notified about
 * incoming messages. The bus is responsible for synchronization of messages
 * ensuring that message listeners are invoked in the UI thread.
 *
 * Message listeners are registered in terms of a partial function defining the
 * messages this listener is interested in. This is analogously to message
 * processing in actors. A listener gets invoked for all messages accepted by
 * its function. To be able to remove a listener again in a convenient way (the
 * listener might only be an anonymous function), a listener registration
 * returns an ID; this ID can then be used for removing the listener again.
