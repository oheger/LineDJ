/**
 * A trait supporting the modification of data produced by a
 * [[FileReaderActor]] before it gets passed to the caller.
 *
 * This trait is kind of an equivalent of the ''FilterInputStream'' class from
 * the Java library. It defines a framework for wrapping a reader actor (nested
 * to an arbitrary level) in which each actor may process data produced by
 * earlier members in the chain.
 *
 * The basic idea is that a ''ReadData'' request is handled by requesting a
 * corresponding amount of data from the wrapped actor. When this data arrives
 * it can be processed and altered if necessary. Processed data can then be
 * published - this causes the data to be sent to the original caller.
 *
 * This trait implements the framework for processing data in this way, but it
 * does not do any processing on its own. The base implementation merely copies
 * the data received from the wrapped actor. Concrete implementations can
 * inject their specific processing logic. A concrete implementation also has
 * to provide the wrapped reader actor.
 *
 * Processing mainly takes place in the methods ''readRequestReceived()'', and
 * ''dataRead()''. The former is called when a request to read data of a
 * certain amount is received. The default implementation forwards this request
 * to the underlying reader actor, but a concrete implementation is free to
 * override this behavior and do different things. ''dataRead()'' is
 * called with data retrieved from the underlying actor. A concrete can
 * evaluate the data received, process it, and finally produce results to be
 * sent to the caller by invoking ''publish()''. Note that it is important
 * that in ''dataRead()'' either ''publish()'' is called or new data is
 * requested from the underlying actor. Otherwise, no data is sent for the
 * original read request!
 *
 * The handling of skip messages is a complex topic. What a skip operation
 * actually means depends on the processing implemented by a specific actor
 * class. For instance, if the actor generates additional data to the output
 * produced by the underlying readers, the number of bytes to be skipped is
 * related to this additional data. Therefore, it is usually not sufficient to
 * simply pass the skip message through to the underlying actor. (Although this
 * mode is supported and makes sense for actors that do not change the size of
 * the file to be read; it can be enabled by overriding the
 * ''passSkipMessagesThrough'' variable to a value of '''true'''.) The default
 * handling of skip messages is to do the normal processing (the corresponding
 * methods are called in the usual way), but to ignore the data to be published
 * until the number of bytes to be skipped is reached. This mechanism is
 * transparent for concrete implementations.
