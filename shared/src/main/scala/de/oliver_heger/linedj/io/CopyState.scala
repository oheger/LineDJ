/**
 * A class holding state information about an operation which copies a file
 * from a reader actor to a writer actor.
 *
 * When doing such a copy operation a bunch of messages have to be handled.
 * Doing this correct and efficient (for instance, the reader actor could
 * already read another chunk of data while the writer is still writing), is
 * hard and error-prone. This class has the goal to simplify the implementation
 * of copy operations.
 *
 * Basically, an instance holds information about the current state of the
 * copy process. Which actor is currently busy, which information has already
 * been read and can be written, is the operation complete, etc.
 * Incoming messages can be passed to the ''update()'' method and produce an
 * updated state instance. In addition, the messages to be passed to the reader
 * and writer actors are generated. Client code only have to call ''update()''
 * repeatedly and serve the reader and writer actors in use until a state
 * indicates that the operation is complete.
 *
 * An initial instance can be queried from the ''init()'' method of the
 * companion object.
 *
 * Note that an instance has a number of fields representing the actual state.
 * These values are typically of less relevance for client code, but they are
 * accessible to have some feedback about the operation in progress.
 *
 * @param readPending flag if currently a read operation is in progress
 * @param writePending flag if currently a write operation is in progress
 * @param pendingResult a pending read result
 * @param readRequest the object for requesting read operations
 * @param readDone flag whether all data has been read
 * @param writeDone flag whether all data has been written
