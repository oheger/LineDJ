/**
 * A data class representing the ID of a medium.
 *
 * A medium is a root of a directory structure containing media files. The URI
 * to this root directory identifies the medium in a unique way. The medium can
 * be described by a medium description file; in this case, meta information
 * is available about this medium.
 *
 * All media files that do not belong to a specific medium are collected as
 * well. The IDs for such mediums do not contain a path to a medium
 * description file. In addition, a synthetic medium is maintained which
 * combines all media without a description. This is a global list of media
 * files which cannot be associated to a specific medium.
 *
 * The media archive can consist of multiple components where each component
 * can contribute media files. To reflect this, a ''MediumID'' contains an ID
 * for the component that is responsible for the associated medum.
 *
 * @param mediumURI the URI which identifies this medium
 * @param mediumDescriptionPath the optional path to the medium description
 *                              file (as string)
 * @param archiveComponentID the ID of the providing archive component
