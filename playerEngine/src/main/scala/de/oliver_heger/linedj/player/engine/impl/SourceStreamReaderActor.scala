/**
  * An actor class that reads audio data from an internet radio stream.
  *
  * This actor implements part of the functionality of a data source for
  * [[PlaybackActor]]. It mainly combines the two actor classes
  * [[M3uReaderActor]] and [[StreamBufferActor]]. An instance is initialized
  * with a [[StreamReference]]. If this reference points to a m3u file,
  * an [[M3uReaderActor]] has to be created to process the file and extract the
  * actual URI of the audio stream. Otherwise, the reference is considered to
  * already represent the audio stream.
  *
  * With the audio stream at hand a [[StreamBufferActor]] is created. This
  * actor handles ''GetAudioData'' messages by delegating to the stream buffer
  * actor. It also deals with the case that the buffer is not yet filled yet,
  * and thus an empty read result is returned. In this case, the request is
  * repeated.
  *
  * It is sometimes necessary to know to the actual URL of the audio stream
  * that is played. Therefore, this actor sends an ''AudioSource'' message to a
  * listener actor passed to the constructor when the final audio stream is
  * determined.
  *
  * Supervision is implemented by delegating to the parent actor.
  *
  * An instance of this actor class can only be used for reading a single
  * audio stream. It cannot be reused and has to be closed afterwards.
  *
  * @param config    the player configuration
  * @param streamRef the reference to the audio stream for playback
  * @param sourceListener reference to an actor that is sent an audio source
  *                       message when the final audio stream is available
