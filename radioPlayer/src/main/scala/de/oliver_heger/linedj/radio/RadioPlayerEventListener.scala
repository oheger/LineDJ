/**
  * A message bus listener for events generated by the radio player.
  *
  * This class processes a subset of radio player events by delegating to the
  * [[RadioController]]. This is mainly related to UI updates, but also to
  * error handling when the current radio source crashes.
  *
  * Most events of interest can be directly forwarded to the controller. One
  * exception is a finished event for an audio source. As radio sources are
  * infinite sources, a finish event indicates an error. Unfortunately, the
  * finished event relates to an audio source, not a radio source. Therefore,
  * the radio source from the previous source changed event is stored and
  * passed in this case.
  *
  * @param controller the radio controller
  * @param player     the radio player
