/**
  * Defines a parser for JSON using the parser combinator library.
  *
  * Note that this is not a general purpose JSON parser, but is specifically
  * tailored for parsing JSON files containing meta data for songs. Such files
  * contain an array of song data in the first level. For each song a bunch of
  * properties can be defined, but there is no nesting of objects, and
  * properties cannot be arrays. All property values are stores as strings.
  *
  * This code is derived from chapter 9 of "Functional Programming in Scala"
  * by Chiusano and Bjarnason.
