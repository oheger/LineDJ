/**
 * An internally used helper class for calculating the IDs of a medium and the
 * files it contains.
 *
 * The ID of a medium is calculated based on its content, i.e. the audio files
 * found in its directory structure. This class performs this calculation.
 * Internally, it uses a CRC32 checksum to determine a medium ID (given the
 * limited number of media, this should be sufficient). The results of this
 * class should be compatible with older versions of the MP3 player engine.
 *
 * For accessing the single files of a medium, string URIs are used derived
 * from the original paths of the files. This class generates a mapping from
 * these logic file URIs to the underlying physical ''Path'' objects. Based on
 * this information, it is possible to identify specific files in arbitrary
 * media in a unique way.
